# Before adding the Ingress Service

Please follow the [Instalation Guid](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/) to have the correct version for your environment.

**ATTENTION**:
if you, like me, are using Docker as a Kubernetes server, please use the [Docker for Mac](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/#docker-for-mac) after the mandatory update. ;-)

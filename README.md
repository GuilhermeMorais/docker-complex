# Docker-Complex

Playing with docker, docker-compose, node and others. To Build an ugly (in all means) and complex solution just to test the integration


## Branch: **dockerComposeFinal** [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/GuilhermeMorais/docker-complex.svg?branch=dockerComposeFinal)](https://travis-ci.org/GuilhermeMorais/docker-complex)

In here we have a Travis configuration to build and push to docker hub (you can setup the azure to grab these images and push to a web app - containers).

## Branch: **Master** [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/GuilhermeMorais/docker-complex.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/GuilhermeMorais/docker-complex)

In here I'm preparing to use Kubernetes/Docker/Travis.
